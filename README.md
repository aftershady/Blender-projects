Blender-Projects
This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of learning Blender and 3D modeling.

It will primarily host small exercises and simple 3D models designed to help me build the skills needed to eventually create high-quality 3D assets for games, animation, or personal projects.

📁 Current Projects
3D Modeling Exercises
Basic shapes, objects, and scenes created to practice Blender tools and workflows.

Stylized Models
Small experiments in creating stylized or game-ready assets, focusing on topology, shading, and texturing.

🚧 What to Expect
Short exercises and modeling studies

Mostly low-poly or beginner-friendly 3D models

Frequent updates as I experiment and improve

Blender files, renders, and practice assets
